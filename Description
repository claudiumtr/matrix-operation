Given the following matrix operation:

C=A×B×Bt+At×A

where:

A
and B
are square matrices of doubles of size N x N

A
is an upper triangular matrix

At
is the transpose of A
and Bt
is the transpose of B

×
is the multiplication operation

+
is the addition operation

We want to implement the above operation in C/C++ in 3 ways:

blas - a variant that uses one or more functions from BLAS Atlas to perform the multiplication and addition operations.
neopt - a “handmade” variant without improvements.
opt_m - an improved variant of the neopt version. The improvement exclusively considers modifying the code to obtain better performance.

Each of the 3 implementations above will take into account the fact that A is an upper triangular matrix.
Running and testing
To test the theme, you are provided with a code skeleton that you must complete with the implementations of the 3 variants mentioned above. The code skeleton is structured as follows:

main.c - contains the main function, as well as other functions used to read the file with the test description, write the result matrix to a file, generate input data and run a test. This file will be overwritten during correction and should not be modified.
utils.h - header file. This file will be overwritten during correction and should not be modified.
solver_blas.c - in this file you must add the implementation of the blas variant.
solver_neopt.c - in this file you must add the implementation of the neopt variant.
solver_opt.c - in this file you must add the implementation of the opt_m variant.
Makefile - Makefile used when compiling with gcc.
compare.c - utility that can be used to compare two result files. This file will be overwritten during the correction and should not be modified.

You can make any changes to the code skeleton except for the 3 files mentioned above.
After running the make command with any of the 2 Makefiles, 3 binary files will result, tema2_blas, tema2_neopt and tema2_opt_m corresponding to the 3 variants that must be implemented.

The execution will be done as follows:
./tema2_<mod> input
where:

mod is one of the modes blas, neopt, opt_m
input is the file containing the description of the tests.

The input file is structured as follows:

on the first line the number of tests.
on the following lines the description of each test:
the value of N.
the seed used to generate the data.
the path to the output file containing the resulting matrix.
